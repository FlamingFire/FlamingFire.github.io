This is the non-pixelated version of the terra blade from Terraria.
Despite doing a ton of damage, it also shoots out magic beams at an insane speed. They insta kill almost everything.
Even Unicorns. Then you use their horns to make armour. It's complicated.

This is not exactly a weapon. More of something done with a weapon. In overwatch, the Medic like character, Mercy has a move that revives all her team mates near her. This can be extremely useful to turn the tides of a battle.
The look of relief when you die and get revived again is beautiful.Her weapon can also attack boost and give a huge heal boost. The only thing bad about it is you can't revive yourself. That would  be OP.</li></ul>
